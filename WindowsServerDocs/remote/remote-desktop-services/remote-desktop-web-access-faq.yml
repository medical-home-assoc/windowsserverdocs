      - question: |
          What is RemoteApp and Desktop Connections?
        answer: |
          RemoteApp and Desktop Connections gives you a customized view of RemoteApp programs and virtual desktops that are available to you.

      - question: |
          What is RemoteApp?
        answer: |
          Using RemoteApp, you can access programs on a remote computer through Remote Desktop Services. Although the programs are running on a remote computer, RemoteApp programs behave as if they're running on your local computer. For example, a RemoteApp program has its own entry in the taskbar, and you can resize, minimize, or maximize the program window.

      - question: |
          How do I start a RemoteApp program?
        answer: |
          To start a RemoteApp program or Remote Desktop session, click the program icon in RD Web Access. When you're prompted for user credentials, log on with your network user name and password.

      - question: |
          What are the public vs. private computer settings?
        answer: |
          If you connect to the RD Web Access website from a public computer, such as a kiosk computer in a public establishment, or from a computer that you share with other users, click This is a public or shared computer. You need to provide both your user name and password each time you sign in to the RD Web Access website.

          If you're using a work computer assigned to you and that you don't share with other people, click This is a private computer.

          To protect against unauthorized access, RD Web Access sessions automatically end after a period of inactivity. If your RD Web Access session ends, you need to sign in again. The amount of time before a session ends is determined by your administrator.
