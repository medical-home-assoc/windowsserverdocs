You can include GPUs in your clusters to provide GPU acceleration to workloads running in clustered VMs. GPU acceleration is provided via Discrete Device Assignment (DDA), which allows you to dedicate one or more physical GPUs to a VM. Clustered VMs can take advantage of GPU acceleration, and clustering capabilities such as high availability via failover. Live migration of virtual machines (VMs) isn't currently supported, but VMs can be automatically restarted and placed where GPU resources are available if there's a failure.

In this article, learn how to use graphics processing units (GPUs) with clustered VMs to provide GPU acceleration to workloads in the clustered VMs. This article guides you through preparing the cluster, assigning a GPU to a cluster VM, and failing over that VM using Windows Admin Center and PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

There are several requirements and things to consider before you begin to use GPUs with clustered VMs:

:::zone pivot="azure-stack-hci"

- You need an Azure Stack HCI cluster running Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2 or later.

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot="windows-server"

- You need a Windows Server Failover cluster running Windows Server 2025 or later.

::: zone-end

- You also need GPUs installed in every server of the cluster.

- Review and follow the instructions from your GPU manufacturer to install the necessary drivers and software on each server in the cluster.

- Depending on your hardware vendor, you might also need to configure any GPU licensing requirements.

- You need a machine with Windows Admin Center installed. This machine could be one of your cluster nodes.

:::zone pivot="windows-server"

- Create a VM to assign the GPU to. Prepare that VM for DDA by setting its cache behavior, stop action, and memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) properties according to the instructions in [Deploy graphics devices using Discrete Device Assignment](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/deploy/deploying-graphics-devices-using-dda).

- Prepare the GPUs in each server by installing security mitigation drivers on each server, disabling the GPUs, and dismounting them from the host. To learn more about this process, see [Deploy graphics devices by using Discrete Device Assignment](Deploying-graphics-devices-using-dda.md).

## Prepare the cluster

When the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are complete, you can prepare the cluster to use GPUs with clustered VMs.

Preparing the cluster involves creating a resource pool that contains the GPUs that are available for assignment to VMs. The cluster uses this pool to determine VM placement for any started or moved VMs that are assigned to the GPU resource pool.

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

Using Windows Admin Center, follow these steps to prepare the cluster to use GPUs with clustered VMs.

To prepare the cluster and assign a VM to a GPU resource pool:

1. Launch Windows Admin Center and make sure the **GPUs** extension is already installed.

1. Select **Cluster Manager** from the top dropdown menu and connect to your cluster.

1. From the **Settings** menu, select **Extensions** > **GPUs**.

1. On the **Tools** menu, under **Extensions**, select **GPUs** to open the tool.

1. On tool's main page, select the **GPU pools** tab, and then select **Create GPU pool**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/create-gpu-pool.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create GPU pools page in Windows Admin Center." lightbox="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/create-gpu-pool.png":::

1. On the **New GPU pool** page, specify the following and then select **Save**:
   1. **Server** name
   1. **GPU pool** name
   1. **GPUs** that you want to add to the pool

   :::image type="content" source="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/new-gpu-pool.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New GPU pool page in Windows Admin Center to specify servers, pool name, and GPUs." lightbox="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/new-gpu-pool.png":::

   After the process completes, you'll receive a success prompt that shows the name of the new GPU pool and the host server.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Follow these steps to prepare the cluster to use GPUs with clustered VMs using PowerShell.

1. Create a new empty resource pool on each server containing the clustered GPU resources. Make sure to provide the same pool name on each server.

    In PowerShell, run the following cmdlet as an administrator:

   ```PowerShell
    New-VMResourcePool -ResourcePoolType PciExpress -Name "GpuChildPool"
   ```

1. Add the dismounted GPUs from each server to the resource pool that you created in the previous step.

    In PowerShell, run the following commands:

   ```PowerShell
    $gpu = Get-VMHostAssignableDevice

    Add-VMHostAssignableDevice -HostAssignableDevice $gpu -ResourcePoolName "GpuChildPool"
   ```

You now have a cluster-wide resource pool (named `GpuChildPool`) that is populated with assignable GPUs. The cluster uses this pool to determine VM placement for any started or moved VMs that are assigned to the GPU resource pool.

---

## Assign a VM to a GPU resource pool

You can now assign a VM to a GPU resource pool. You can assign one or more VMs to a clustered GPU resource pool, and remove a VM from a clustered GPU resource pool.

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

Follow these steps to assign an existing VM to a GPU resource pool using Windows Admin Center.

>[!NOTE]
> You also need to install drivers from your GPU manufacturer inside the VM so that apps in the VM can take advantage of the GPU assigned to them.

1. On the **Assign VM to GPU pool** page, specify the following, then select **Assign**:
   1. **Server** name
   1. **GPU pool** name
   1. **Virtual machine** that you want to assign the GPU to from the GPU pool.

   You can also define advanced setting values for memory-mapped IO (MMIO) spaces to determine resource requirements for a single GPU.

   :::image type="content" source="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/assign-vm-to-gpu-pool.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Assign VM to GPU pool page in Windows Admin Center where you assign a VM to a GPU from the GPU pool." lightbox="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/assign-vm-to-gpu-pool.png":::

   After the process completes, you'll receive a confirmation prompt that shows you successfully assigned the GPU from the GPU resource pool to the VM, which displays under **Assigned VMs**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/gpu-assigned-to-vm-confirmed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of success prompt showing GPU assigned to a VM and the VM displaying under Assigned VMs." lightbox="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/gpu-assigned-to-vm-confirmed.png":::

To unassign a VM from a GPU resource pool:

1. On the **GPU pools** tab, select the GPU that you want to unassign, and then select **Unassign VM**.

1. On the **Unassign VM from GPU pool** page, in the **Virtual machines** list box, specify the name of the VM, and then select **Unassign**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/unassign-vm-from-gpu-pool.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Unassign VM from GPU pool page showing VM to be unassigned." lightbox="media/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm/unassign-vm-from-gpu-pool.png":::

   After the process completes, you receive a success prompt that the VM has been unassigned from the GPU pool, and under **Assignment status** the GPU shows **Available (Not assigned)**.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Follow these steps to assign an existing VM to a GPU resource pool using PowerShell.

1. Configure the cluster VM resourceâ€™s default offline action as `force-shutdown` rather than `save`. Make sure to replace `<vmname>` with the name of the VM that you want to assign to the GPU resource pool.

    In PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

   ```PowerShell
    Get-ClusterResource -name <vmname> | Set-ClusterParameter -Name "OfflineAction" -Value 3
   ```

1. Assign the resource pool that you created earlier to the VM. Assigning the resource pool declares to the cluster that the VM requires an assigned device from the `GpuChildPool` pool when it's started or moved.

    In PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

   ```PowerShell
    Get-ClusterResource -name <vmname> | Add-VMAssignableDevice -ResourcePoolName "GpuChildPool"
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   > If you want to add more than one GPU to the VM, first verify that the resource pool has more than one assignable GPU available, and then run the previous command again.

You can also remove an assigned GPU from a VM. To do so, in PowerShell, run the following command. Make sure to replace `<vmname>` with the name of the VM that you want to assign to the GPU resource pool.

   ```PowerShell
   $vm = Get-VMAssignableDevice -VMName <vmname> | Where-Object { $_.ResourcePoolName -eq "GpuChildPool" }

   $vm | Remove-VMAssignableDevice
   ```

---

When you start the VM, the cluster ensures that the VM is placed on a server with available GPU resources from this cluster-wide pool. The cluster also assigns the GPU to the VM through DDA, which allows the GPU to be accessed from workloads inside the VM.

## Fail over a VM with an assigned GPU

:::zone pivot="windows-server"
To test the clusterâ€™s ability to keep your GPU workload available, perform a drain operation on the server where the VM is running with an assigned GPU. To drain the server, follow the instructions in [Failover cluster maintenance procedures](/azure-stack/hci/manage/maintain-servers?toc=/windows-server/administration/toc.json&bc=/windows-server/breadcrumbs/toc.json). The cluster restarts the VM on another server in the cluster, as long as another server has sufficient available GPU resources in the pool that you created.
